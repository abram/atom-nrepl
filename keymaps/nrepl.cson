# Keybindings require three things to be fully defined: A selector that is
# matched against the focused element, the keystroke and the command to
# execute.
#
# Below is a basic keybinding which registers on all platforms by applying to
# the root workspace element.

# For more detailed documentation see
# https://www.atom.io/docs/latest/internals/keymaps
'.workspace':
  'ctrl-alt-o': 'nrepl:eval'

# You can also target specific platforms by using the `platform-darwin` or
# `platform-win32` classes on the workspace element like so:
#
# Note: this binding will override the other binding as the CSS is more
# specific than that of the keybinding above.
'.workspace.platform-darwin':
  'cmd-alt-ctrl-o': 'nrepl:toggle'
